Examples

Some examples are available in the =meuh/gui= directory. Simply run
=qmake= with the corresponding =.pro= file, then =make= should build
the example in the =meuh/app= directory.

* Screw 

  Demonstrates screw motion interpolation. This example shows a basic
  example of Lie group computation to perform tangent linear
  interpolation.
  
* Curve 
  
  This example shows how to create an interpolation curve for rigid
  transforms, based on quaternion splines by Kim97 (TODO check
  reference).
  
* Clip
  
  Loads and displays a BVH motion capture sequence.

* TODO Control
